# v1 Spec
*Aug 8 2024*
This outlines the product requires for the inital version of the Racing app

## Goals
The goals of the v1 version are:
1. âœ… Race committee can easily register a racer
2. Race committee can easily run a race (start, log finishers)
2. Quickly tabulate the scores at the end of the race day

Non-goals include
- Persisting data. It's okay if the data is emailed or uploaded as a JSON blob
- Providing an interface for sailors
- Reviewing data from previous race days

## Features
v1 will only provide the bare level of features for running a race day.

* **Register users**
  Record a sailor, their sail number, and their fleet. Assign new racers a unique ID
* **Run a race**
  * **Create a Race Day**
    A race day is the core object to which everything else is attached, so it should be created first.
  * **Start a race**
    Once the minimum number of sailors are registered, the first race can be started.
  * **Record finishes**
    Capture the place of different racers finishing
    * Capture DSQs
* **Calculate the score**
  Present the score in an easy to digest fashion

## Data and state
The app needs to work offline. The expectation should be that the app only exchanges data with the server at the beginning and end of a race day.

**Zustand** will be used for state management as well as caching in `localStorage` of the data. Because (1) changes to the data  need to be cached, and (2) the caching methods are exposed via a hook that must be called in a functional component, we *should not create custom classes for our domain objects.* Instead, methods that update cached data should be methods within the Zustand store.

Much of the data model is relational, and we capture this in a normalized structure where different stores reference one anothers objects. Doing so adds in the possiblity of inefficiencies due to re-renders, but as most of the data is created serially (e.g. all sailors are created first, then a single race is created, and then a list of finishers is created) and most views are only showing a slice of the data, many of the inefficiencies should be avoided.

### State and structure
Zustand recommends breaking apart stores for different sets of data to minimize re-renders and complexity.

```
RacerStore
- racers: ParticipantSchema[]
- addRacer: (name: string) => ParticipantSchema

RaceStore
- races: RaceSchema[]
- startRace: (fleet: FleetSchema) => RaceSchema

FinisherStore
- finishRacer: (racerId: string, raceId: string) => FinisherSchema
- failRacer: (racerId: string, raceId: string, failure: FailureSchema)
```


```
Racer
|- Sailor
|  |- id
|  |- name
|- fleet
|- sailNumber
|- note

Race
|- ID
|- fleet
|- startTime
|- notes[]

Finisher
|- Racer.Sailor.ID
|- Race.ID
|- finishedAt
|- failure

```

### Initial data
Races are initially empty, and racers are loaded from a hard coded config file
* ```const races = []```
* ```const racers = CONFIG.racers```

### Data changes
There are several times when data is written:

| Event | Frequency | Notes |
|:------|-----------|-------|
| When the raceday is created | Once |
| When a new racer is added | ~ 20 times | Maybe hard code racers to start? |
| When a race is started | ~ 10 times |
| When a racer finishes in a race | ~ 10 * 20 times |
| When a race is completed |  ~ 10 times |

To persist the 

### Storing data
All data storage will be done with local storage as one large JSON blob.

### Exporting data
Exported data is stored in a Google Sheet.
